# Plan Document Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a plan document reviewer subagent.

**Purpose:** Verify the plan is complete, matches the spec, and has proper task decomposition.

**Dispatch only when requested:** Review the outline after it is written; writing-plans does not require this review.

```
Subagent (general-purpose):
  description: "Review plan document"
  prompt: |
    You are a plan document reviewer. Verify this plan is complete and ready for implementation.

    **Plan to review:** [PLAN_FILE_PATH]
    **Spec for reference:** [SPEC_FILE_PATH]

    ## What to Check

    | Category | What to Look For |
    |----------|------------------|
    | Completeness | Missing deliverables, affected areas, or acceptance criteria |
    | Spec Alignment | Plan covers spec requirements, no major scope creep |
    | Task Decomposition | Tasks have clear boundaries, outcomes are actionable |
    | Buildability | Are scope, dependencies, and expected behavior clear enough to begin? |

    ## Calibration

    **Only flag issues that would cause real problems during implementation.**
    An implementer building the wrong thing or getting stuck is an issue.
    Minor wording, stylistic preferences, and "nice to have" suggestions are not.

    Approve unless there are serious gaps — missing requirements from the spec,
    contradictory requirements, or tasks so vague they cannot be acted on.

    An outline intentionally leaves code, test bodies, internal signatures, and
    command sequences to implementation. Their absence is not a review issue.
